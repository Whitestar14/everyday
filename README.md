# everyday

A gentle task manager designed specifically for ADHD brains. Every interaction prioritizes emotional safety and reduces cognitive load.

## Philosophy

Traditional todo apps can feel overwhelming and judgmental. **everyday** takes a different approach:

- **Gentle language** - "add something" instead of "CREATE TASK"
- **Warm interactions** - Soft animations and encouraging feedback
- **Forgiving design** - Easy to add, remove, and modify without pressure
- **ADHD-friendly** - Minimal cognitive load, warm color palette, no harsh whites

## Features

- âœ… Simple task input with soft styling
- âœ… Gentle hover states and micro-interactions
- âœ… Warm, cozy color palette (terracotta, sage, peach)

- ðŸ”„ Persistent storage (localStorage) - *in progress*
